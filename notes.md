Chemical intuition -> functional groups -> physical insight

Chemical modifications such as removing functional groups to understand their impact on interactions

One strength of using an EDA is that it is a very general way of interpreting without performing the sort of non-general chemical transformations required in the wet lab or

A great strength of quantum chemistry is that it enables construction of molecular models using the building blocks of chemical intuition, such as interactions between functional groups, which can in theory be correlated with any information present in the wavefunction. As I will show that it is possible to formulated many {common, valuable} spectroscopies, even with approximate wavefunctions, it is possible to connect the features of a molecular model with [hydrogen bonding in a water cluster] molecular properties. This is of paramount importance to experimental spectroscopy, where there is not always an obvious "signature" that connects features in complex molecular systems to a distinct spectroscopic response.

Not possible to draw conclusions from experimental results without the aid of calculations.

A great strength of quantum chemistry is that it enables construction of molecular models using the building blocks of chemical intuition, such as interactions between functional groups, which can in theory be correlated with any information present in the wavefunction. Furthermore, the ability to calculate spectroscopic parameters from wavefunctions makes it possible to connect the features of a molecular model with molecular properties. This is of paramount importance to experimental spectroscopy, where there is not always an obvious "signature" that connects features in complex molecular systems to a distinct spectroscopic response. As a result, it is often not possible to draw conclusions from experimental results without the aid of quantum chemical calculations.

Finding correlation between molecular models and spectra is of great value, but there is also difficulty from the computational side in terms of identifying the \emph{correct} molecular models and \emph{why} they are correct in explaining experimental spectra. To form true structure-spectra relationships, the most desirable connection is through the building blocks of chemistry, functional groups, and identifying the impact of their interactions. A common approach in both the wet lab and computationally is to remove or modify functional groups in some systematic way, resulting in a qualitative connection between structural components and changes in spectra. The drawbacks of such chemical transformations are the inability to quantify the physics behind these chemically-intuitive changes, and potential side-effects of perturbing a molecular model's electronic and geometric structure due to cooperativity. One path to quantifying intermolecular interactions without such drastic chemical modifications is by fragmenting the system into groups of interest and decomposing their interaction energy into physically-motivated terms through a procedure called \emph{energy decomposition analysis} (EDA). If EDA can be applied to spectra prediction, then the underlying causes of spectral changes due to specific chemical motifs can be quantified. More importantly, spectra-property relationships can be formed, where knowledge of
