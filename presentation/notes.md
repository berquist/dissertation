## Dan

- Didn't understand Dan's question about "building up"

## Tom

- major spectroscopic challenge -- inhomogeneous environments
- **suggestion: assertion-evidence style**
- **give me more explanation on method**
- "not excited states, just looking at polarizability" -- this statement did not make sense to me
- What is an IL? What makes it useful?
- Why these ILs?
- "Screening" -- how long does it take to run your calculation?
- Suggest reordering slides to put some more method background first
- slide 16: method? basis? very unclear
- How did you do this? (ALMO EDA decomp) [you later went through this to some degree]
- What's a COVP?
- Did you ever define an ALMO?
- Do people know what a Linear Response is? 
- **What's the usefulness of being able to calculate any arbitrary linear response and decompose it like this?**

## Regular meeting

- use vibrational frequency calculations to help understand CO2 solvation by ionic liquids
- a key part of this analysis was energy decomposition analysis
- outcomes: what to do in the future
