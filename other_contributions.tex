\chapter{OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS}

Other work I contributed to:

\begin{itemize}
\item The initial Q-Chem 4 paper (ref). My contribution was the integration of our group's density embedding and fractional occupation number codes into the Q-Chem codebase.
\item The upcoming glutamine paper, ``UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy Monitors the \(\chi_2\) Angle of the Glutamine Sidechain''. My contribution will be all the DFT calculations of the vibrational frequency dependence of the glutamine \(\chi_2\) angle in the sidechain.
\item The upcoming Q-Chem 5 paper. My contribution will be the addition of \texttt{libresponse} for calculating molecular response properties from absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs) into the Q-Chem codebase, essentially the implementation of paper number 4.
\end{itemize}
