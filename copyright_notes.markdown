# Notes

* The JCP and JPCB papers are not open access.
* The Chemrxiv preprints are [CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). It seems like ND is not optimal.
* want right to read _and_ reuse
* can put entire source on GitHub even with CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0?
* mixed licensing of different chapters?
* license for introductory chapter? some notes compiled from other sources
* going to put the introductory chapter (modified) on ArXiV

I ticked the box on the ProQuest sheet for my dissertation to be published under open access. However, I can't find in any of their literature (accessible from here) what license this is under, since it's never specified. Does this mean I can pick whatever CC license is right for me and place it online without fear of repercussion? Thank you.

> This is a great question. We’ve asked this before of ProQuest, and according to them, you can put any CC license on it that you like. The reason for that is that you sign a separate non-exclusive license with ProQuest for them to use your dissertation as part of their program, so that permission exists beyond the terms of the CC license.

# [What kind of Creative Commons license is best for a PhD thesis?](https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-Creative-Commons-license-is-best-for-a-PhD-thesis)

> It doesn't really matter that it's a PhD thesis -- the decision about using a CC license should be based on what kinds of outcomes you want. Do you want the knowledge you've created/assembled to be widely available? Do you want to be attributed for your work? Do you have any aspirations for the work that might be interfered with if you publish it first? (e.g., publishing it somewhere that will be particular about whether it has been previously published)?

> Assuming that there's no downside to you publishing it, I'll assume that you want to get the knowledge out there, and that you'd like to keep your name attached. In that case, use CC BY (aka CC Attribution). That will allow anybody to republish it for any purpose, with or without modification, crediting your original work. It's compatible with putting it on Wikisource, the Internet Archive, and any number of "green open access" repositories. You could also use CC BY-SA, but I don't think there's any significant advantage to that license, especially for a text work.

> If you don't care about attribution, you could also use CC0, which essentially puts it in the public domain.

> I'd avoid anything with the NC (non-commercial) or ND (no derivative works) provision. You can find reasons on this web site: http://freedomdefined.org
