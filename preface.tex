I have found that there are many people, places, and things to blame for the creation of this dissertation, which may surprise those who only know me via a sometimes surly attitude. The first is my advisor, Daniel Secretary Lambrecht, who never got frustrated with me when I wasn't being productive, and mostly left me to my own devices, presumably because he didn't want to deal with me not knowing Vim and gnuplot. I will miss our discussions about how woodwind instruments are different from brass, how perfect the San Francisco weather is, how confusing the \texttt{NBasis/NBas6D/NB2/NB2car} mess is in \textsc{Q-Chem}, and what directions quantum chemistry is and should be heading in. I promise to never use B3LYP/6-31G** for anything ever again. More importantly, thank you for countering my occasionally poor communication skills and negative outlook with positive words of encouragement. I also want to thank Sean Garrett-Roe, who aside from always trying to make a collaboration with experimentalists as painless as possible, perhaps surpasses even me with fervent disgust toward Microsoft Word and was always a willing ear for my rants about computational chemists not using \LaTeX{}. You are a model for how well-rounded a scientist should be that I strove to emulate. I thank Ken Jordan for supervising me during my first summer at Pitt, and teaching me that some printers may prefer to work in atomic units.

I thank Thomas Brinzer for all the work he did in our collaboration, trying to get me to understand 2D-IR, and his always thoughtful critique of my work. You are the model for how a graduate student should be that I strove to emulate.

As a strong believer in learning one's tools, I thank Emacs for making me faster at editing text than Ben Albrecht, who learned with me that people shouldn't share flash drives when printing posters, always kept me on my programming toes, and showed that it is possible to successfully transition out of academia. I thank Kevin Gasperich, Shiv Upadhyay, Amanda Dumi, and Daniel Burrill for joining me at weekly programming study groups that often got derailed as they learned how to push my buttons. I thank Keith Werling for being my original partner-in-crime as Daniel's other first student (though you are really the zeroth), and I also apologize for the attitude I carried during the middle years. Hopefully I've grown up slightly. I thank Adam Gagorik for his patience while teaching me how to use Matplotlib and the example he set for getting work done as a graduate student while keeping a personal life. I thank Daniel Bolt, Tyler Rohrs, and Halina Werner for tolerating some truly bad bowling strings while my mind was in other places, talking coffee, going to the symphony, and attending my own performances. There is not much else I will miss about Pittsburgh, but I thank Forward Lanes, Row House Cinema, the Hollywood Theater, and Voodoo Brewery for providing places to go other than my computer.

I thank Adam Pratt and Tuguldur Togo Odbadrakh (Togie Stogie? Tuguldur Schmuguldur? Togo Schmogo?) for being there since the beginning, and again I must apologize.

There are people from home who helped me as well. I thank Car Chat for coming to visit me and welcoming me every time I came home, especially Brendan Reilly, who introduced me to anime and indirectly got me started playing music again. I thank Garen Chiloyan for listening to me complain about almost everything since the start of undergrad, sharing grad school gossip, and agreeing that Massachusetts really is the best. I thank Marshall Brennan for explaining what I should expect in grad school and being right about 99\% of it.

My degree would not have been completed if not for the massive amount of music I listened to, primarily from Alfred Brendel, Francesco Corti, Passepied, and Judy Bedford, my original bassoon instructor who gave me most of my musical knowledge.

Finally but most importantly, I thank my parents, John and Gavra. You are my most passionate supporters, loudest critics, and best friends. Only you understand how difficult this was for me. I love you.
